    # RUSTSEC-2024-0421: idna 0.4.0 accepts malformed Punycode labels.
    # Via: validator 0.16.x → url → idna.
    # Not exploitable: the app performs no user-supplied URL or IDN parsing.
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0421",

    # RUSTSEC-2024-0363: sqlx 0.7.4 binary protocol misinterpretation via
    # truncating/overflowing casts. Fix: upgrade to sqlx >= 0.8.1.
    # Tracked: sqlx 0.7 → 0.8 is a breaking upgrade; scheduled for Phase 3.
    # Risk is low in practice — the vulnerability requires a malicious DB server
    # response, which is not a threat model concern for a self-hosted private app.

    # Via: sqlx-mysql 0.7.4 (transitively compiled even though MySQL is unused).
    # No fix available upstream. Not exploitable: the app uses PostgreSQL only
    # and never calls any RSA decryption path.
