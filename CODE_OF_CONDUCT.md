# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a welcoming,
harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**We welcome:**

- Kind, constructive feedback on code and ideas
- Helping newcomers get up to speed, whatever their background
- Respectful disagreement on technical matters
- Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them

**We do not tolerate:**

- Homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, or any other discriminatory language or behavior
- Personal attacks or insults, including those directed at the author's use of assistive tools
- Sexual language, imagery, or unwelcome advances of any kind
- Threats of violence or intimidation
- Doxxing or sharing someone's private information without consent
- Harassment in any form, public or private
- Dismissing someone's contributions because of how they work (with assistants, screen readers,
  voice input, or any other accessibility tool)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying these standards and taking fair, corrective
action in response to any behavior that violates them. Maintainers have the right to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with
this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions,
and any other forum where this project's community gathers.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a private discussion or contacting
the maintainer directly at **jordan@jordanjenkins.com**. All reports will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and confidentially.

Maintainers who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face consequences as
determined by the project leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
